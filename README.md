# Automation-of-Exam-Controller

This project implementation for devloping automation of Exam controller, CU.This Project implemented using Ruby of Rails Framework. The traditional hand-written system is not only time consuming and erroneous but also costly system. Moreover,
it is less durable due to its difficult storing mechanism. This automated system not only helps for
students but also help for teachers and academic officers. Thatâ€™s why we want to develop an
automated system for the Office of Exam controller for reducing time, effort and cost of
students, teachers and academic officers. Furthermore, our government is promoting the
digitization process in every sector for citizen charter with the goals of Digital Bangladesh
Vision. Our proposal contains three major components: automation, old-content digitization, and
restructuring the controller office.
